Compiling
---------

    In general it should be enough to type
        make his
    which creates a local binary 'his'.

    Next type
        make install	
    which puts his in your private bin directory (under $HOME). Or use
        BINDIR=/what/ever make install
    to install to /what/ever.

    To remove artifacts, type
        make clean

    The code depends on sqlite3, and you need to have the headers and the
    development lib available during compilation and linking. On debian-based
    systems, you may need to 'sudo apt-get install libsqlite-dev'. Whichever
    distribution you use, make sure that #include <sqlite3.h> works and that
    -lsqlite3 finds libsqlite3.a. If you have different paths, then you might
    need to adapt the Makefile.
