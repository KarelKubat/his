Welcome to his %s, a CLI history tracker and finder of old invocations.
Copyright (c) %s. %s. Distributed under GNU GPLV3.
See %s for more info. Use his as follows:

his [--flags] ARGS
  Displays history having ARGS. Use 'what' to exactly match, or 'what%%' to
  match anything starting with what, or '%%what' for anything ending in what,
  or '%%what%%' for whatever has what in it, or '__at' for anything that is 4
  characters long and ends with at. Use flags --first=FROM and --last=TO if you
  want to time-limit.

his [--flags] -a,--add LINE
  Adds LINE to the history, see --list-formats for the supported parsing
  formats and --format=X to select a format.

his [--flags] -e,--export
  Shows a list of the last 20 historical entries. Flags --first=FROM and
  --last=TO may be helpful. Or --count=MAX to show more or less than 20.

his [--flags] -i,--import
  Import a list in the same format as his --export produces. Flags --first=FROM
  and --last=TO can be used to limit the imported entries. Implies --format=2
  and no --multi-args.

his -R
  Shows the README and stops.

Supported general flags:
  -d,--db=DB        : Sets Sqlite3 database path, default is $HOME/.his.db
  -f,--first=STAMP  : Limits exports and searches to later or equal to STAMP,
                      with STAMP having the format: YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS
  -F,--format=FMT   : Sets the format for parsing during --add
  -l,--last=STAMP   : Limits exports and searches to earlier or equal to STAMP
  -L,--list-formats : Shows available parsing formats and stops
  -m,--multi-args   : During --add, LINE is assumed to to have all args
                      separately (as in ls -Flag). Default is all in one string
                      (as in 'ls -Flag').
  -v,--verbose      : Increases verbosity
  -h,-?,--help      : Shows this text and stops
  --                : Stops parsing flags. Very useful in
                        his --add -- $WHATEVER
                      (when WHATEVER starts with a --flag)
