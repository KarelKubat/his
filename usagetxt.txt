Welcome to his %s, a CLI history tracker and finder of old invocations.
Copyright (c) %s. %s. Distributed under GNU GPLV3.
See %s for more info. Use his as follows:

his [--flags] [ARGS]

  Displays history having ARGS or the last entered ones. Use 'what' to exactly
  match, or 'what%%' to match anything starting with what, or '%%what' for
  anything ending in what, or '%%what%%' for whatever has what in it, or '__at'
  for anything that is 4 characters long and ends with at.

  Use flags --first=FROM and --last=TO if you want to time-limit.
  Use flag  --count=NR to limit the displayed entries, default is 20 last.
  Use flag  --utc to output timestams relative to GMT, default is local.

his [--flags] -a,--add LINE
  Adds LINE to the history, see --list-formats for the supported parsing
  formats of LINE and --format=X to select a format.

his [--flags] -i,--import
  Import from stdin in the same format as a listing. Flags --first=FROM and
  --last=TO can be used to limit what to import. Implies --format=2.
  Add flag --utc if the list to import was generated with --utc (recommended).

his [--flags] -p,--purge
  Remove entries from the database. Flags -f,--first and -l,--last must be
  given to avoid mistakenly removing everything.

Supported general flags:
  -d,--db=DB        : Sets Sqlite3 database path, default is $HOME/.his.db
  -f,--first=STAMP  : Limits exports and searches to later or equal to STAMP,
                      with STAMP having the format: YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS
  -F,--format=FMT   : Sets the format for parsing during --add
  -l,--last=STAMP   : Limits exports and searches to earlier or equal to STAMP
  -L,--list-formats : Shows available parsing formats and stops
  -m,--multi-args   : During --add, LINE is assumed to to have all args
                      separately (as in ls -Flag). Default is all in one string
                      (as in 'ls -Flag').
  -u,--utc          : Timestamps in listed output or imported input are assumed
                      UTC (default: local time)
  -v,--verbose      : Increases verbosity
  -h,-?,--help      : Shows this text and stops
  --                : Stops parsing flags. Very useful in
                        his --add -- $WHATEVER
                      (when WHATEVER starts with a --flag)
