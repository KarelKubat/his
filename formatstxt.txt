Available formats are identified by a number. Available are:

--format=1:
  Selects a format where a history number (unused), a datestamp, and a command
  are present. Example:
    2087  [2017-08-22 13:57:32 +0200] ls -ltr /tmp
  This is the format for the bash expression '$(history 1)' once you
  set
    export HISTTIMEFORMAT="[%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M:%%S %%z] "
  which is recommended -- it makes your Bash builtin command 'history' behave
  much nicer and his will understand it by default.
  
  The leading number (2087) is a byproduct of bash and is unused. The datestamp
  is spread out over two or three parts and must follow the syntax (including
  the shown square brackets):
    [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]         (this is assumed UTC) or
    [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-HHMM] (this is assumed localtime, with offset to
                                   UTC)

--format=2:
  Selects the format that is also used during listing and --import: a date/time
  and the command. The date/time are assumed to be UTC. Example:
    2017-08-15/05:33:47 cat /tmp/myfile.c

--format=3:
  Selects a format where a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01, UTC) is
  followed by any arguments. This is handy when you can get a $(time +%%s) in
  but it's least human-readable of the formats. Example:
    1503505272 find /var/log -type f -name apache*

More formats are not supported at this time.
